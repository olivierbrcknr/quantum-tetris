            <p>
              What would happen if you combine Tetris with a Quantum computer? The winning entry of the 
              <span class="footnoteLabel"
                >Quantum Design Jam from IBM and Parsons</span
              >
              in October 2021 explores just that!
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
              Quantum Tetris game investigates the concept of true
              randomness in games and celebrates noise—a beautiful imperfection
              of the current generation of quantum computers. Have you ever
              wondered what is random? In today's world, classical computers can
              merely generate pseudo-random numbers using seeds. The promise of a
              perfect, zero-noise quantum computer hints at the possibility of
              true randomness.
            </p>
            <p>
              We decided to use Tetris—a well-known game—to explore the visualise of true random generated by a quantum computer.
              In classic Tetris, a player can theoretically predict which
              block appears next, if they knew the seed of the random
              function. A quantum computer can create truly random numbers, thus ensuring true randomness which cannot be predicted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, quantum computers, still in their nascency, produce a lot of false values as they perform calculations.
              Qubits cannot hold their state for long, resulting in occasional
              erroneous calculations. This phenomenon is called <i>noise</i>. The
              longer the circuit, the more probable it is that a calculation is
              disturbed, hence more noise appears.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, noise is an unwanted side effect. However, we could see the potential of using this noise to great effect  
              to supercharge a game of Tetris! We programmed a quantum computer to generate the regular seven kinds of Tetris blocks. 
              The noise produced by the quantum computer created blocks
              that were not intended, allowing for new blocks that do not fall in
              the regular 'four pieces attached' Tetris ruleset, creating a whole new
              Tetris experience. These strange, and irregular "noisy shapes" are a result of
              the miscalculations which occur when running the calculations on a quantum
              computer. If you play the the game above, you'll see those new blocks, which are highlighted in red. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only is Quantum Tetris a fun game, but it's also a great metaphor for a quantum circuit. The longer you
              play, the more noisy shapes appear, just like the longer you run a calculation on a quantum computer, the more noise you'll encounter.

                It can also happen that accidentally a real tetromino is
                generated through the noise. This happens due to the fact, that
                some tetrominos fit in more than one combination of our grid,
                and we do not filter them out (yet).

            <h2>Concept</h2>

            <p>
              To communicate the noise in quantum, we searched for a simple
              way to display binary data—so <code>0</code>s and
              <code>1</code>s—the output of a quantum calculation. As we wanted
              to focus on the topic noise in quantum operations, we needed to
              also find an example which is not only easy to represent in this
              binary format, but also an example that showcases the unwanted
              results of the binary combinations. 
              We wanted to create something which allows for the 'noise' generated to add to the experience.
              For example, if we tasked a quantum computer to 
              generate random images consisting of black and white pixels (where <code>0</code> is white and <code>1</code> is black) , we would not be able to see the noise, 
              as we wouldn't be able to distinguish between 'true' random outputs, and 'noise' affected random outputs. The results for both 
              would visually appear to be identical—both would look like scrambled black and white images.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we needed to highlight the 'noise', we didn't want the results to be too distracting either.
              The noise needed to represented by an unwanted element but not to a detrimental degree which would adversely affect the 
              experience. For example, if we assigned the quantum computer to generate an image of the ocean and the 'noise' 
              manifested in the form of unrelated objects appearing in the image, like a tree, that wouldn't be an accurate representation 
              of the concept as trees were not a part of the equation in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also wanted to make something which would include elements of play so that the concept is easier to understand 
              and also more fun! This led us to look at popular games, especially older ones that are
              easier to replicate. We quickly narrowed in on Tetris, as it's popular, and easy to play—an ageless classic.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started with translating the tetrominos (the Tetris blocks)
              into a simple grid, that we could describe with binary digits. Tetris
              blocks always consist of
              <span class="footnoteLabel">four connected squares</span>. One can
              thus can fit all possible "real" tetromino combinations in a
              <code>2×4</code> grid. This can be represented again in a simple
              bit array mapping to the single cells of the grid.<span
                class="note"
                >(Fig. 1)</span
              >
              This way we can map a buffer of eight digits to any existing block
              we want. E.g., <code>0010 1011</code> would then translate into
              the "L" tetromino.<span class="note">(Fig. 2)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on this system, we can generate all possible blocks by only 
              using <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s. But in this particular
              example, a different combination of these digits would result in unintentional and strange  
              Tetris blocks. Here the noise affects the regular code
              in a very specific way, which makes it a great representation of how noise
              alters the usual and anticipated outcome. So, an example of a
              noise-tetromino would consist of more or less than the regular four
              blocks, or
              <span class="footnoteLabel"
                >have them arranged in a different way</span
              >, generating other combinations, that usually do not exist in the
              game.<span class="note">(Fig. 3)</span>

            <h2>The Quantum Circuit</h2>
            <p>
              Based on our model which translates the blocks to a simple binary code,
              we were able to generate the quantum circuit. Generally, by just
              positioning a qubit in a default superposition, we would receive
              <i>truly random</i> binary combinations. This however, would
              result in just random pieces. This would defy our goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we needed to map all the relevant combinations for the
              seven tetrominos that exist in the original game. Using the
              resulting seven binary strings, we can define the logical
              probabilities after each digit to eventually get an equal
              distribution of all pieces.<span class="note">(Fig. 4)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Knowing this, we were able to create a relatively straightforward
              quantum circuit which would only generate these exact seven blocks.<span
                class="note"
                >(Fig. 5)</span
              >
              Theoretically, in a perfect quantum system, <i>only</i> one of
              these seven blocks should result at the end of
              <span class="footnoteLabel">the circuit</span>. Running this
              circuit multiple times would then generate a truly random set of
              pieces. But (which happens to be the purpose of this project) quantum
              circuits <i>are not</i> perfect (yet). Due to the very instable
              state of a qubit, it's possible that a qubit changes
              its orientation spontaneously, thus affecting the subsequent
              measurements of its position—which results in the noise within the circuit. Due to 
              this noise, the circuit produces bit arrays that should 
              theoretically not be possible in its layout, which happen to be our red quantum, noisy 
              tetrominos.
            </p>
            <p>
              The longer a circuit is, the more often a qubit is
              measured, which makes it more likely that noise is likely to interfere with the result of
              the calculation. In our case the calculation for one block is
              fairly long, which increasing the probability of irregular blocks.

                    This is the visualization that we used to map the
                    probabilities to our circuit. A branch to the left means if
                    it hits <code>1</code> and a branch to the right results in
                    <code>0</code>. Each column represent a digit of our buffer.
                    The red numbers indicate the probability that is needed, or
                    in our case, the superposition the cubit needs to be put in.

                    At the end of each branch you can see the final buffer and
                    its corresponding tetromino.

            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p>
              With Quantum Tetris, we want to showcase the beauty of noise generated by quantum computing 
              in a playful manner. Much in the same way, we like 
              imperfections in other media, like analogue photography, or vinyl records.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another interesting factor in quantum computing that we want to
              highlight here is the potential of actual, pure randomness. Qubits
              allow for a <i>real</i> random generation of values, in contrast
              to the other methods that currently exist, which are based on some sort of seed value which determines
              the outcome of every randomly generated number.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a quantum computer is not meant to execute its calculations in
              real time (like personal computers) but rather, to get a task,
              calculate it, and then return the results, we precalculated a
              batch of blocks that are selected in our game. Even though it's not real time generation, the blocks
              themselves were still actually generated on a real quantum
              computer from IBM.
            </p>
            <p>
              To amplify the trait of quantum computing that the longer a
              circuit is, the more noise will likely appear, we included a
              simple (not <i>truly</i> quantum) mechanism which will spawn more
              irregular tetrominos the longer a game is played. The longer you a game of Quantum Tetris goes on for, 
              the more noisy blocks you'll encounter. Play the game above and see for yourself!

              With a NES-like controller, it feels just like playing the cult classic GameBoy Tetris!
              When not being actively played, the game continues to drop blocks and functions as a passive art piece.
